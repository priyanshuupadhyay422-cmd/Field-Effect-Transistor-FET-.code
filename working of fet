Field Effect Transistor (FET)
1. Reading / Understanding FET

A Field Effect Transistor (FET) is a voltage-controlled semiconductor device in which the flow of current between the drain and source terminals is controlled by an electric field applied at the gate terminal.
FET is a unipolar device, meaning current conduction occurs due to only one type of charge carrier (electrons or holes).
Because of its high input impedance and low noise, FET is widely used in analog circuits and integrated circuits.

2. Construction of FET

A basic FET consists of three terminals:

Gate (G): Controls the channel conductivity

Source (S): Supplies charge carriers

Drain (D): Collects charge carriers

In JFET, the gate forms a PN junction with the channel, while in MOSFET, the gate is insulated from the channel by a thin oxide layer.

3. Working Principle of FET

The working of FET is based on the control of channel width using an electric field:

When VGS = 0, maximum current flows through the channel

Increasing reverse bias at the gate reduces channel width

At pinch-off voltage, the channel becomes narrow and drain current saturates

Further increase in VDS does not significantly increase drain current

Thus, the drain current (ID) is controlled by the gate-source voltage (VGS).

4. Characteristics and Analysis

FET operation is studied using:

Drain Characteristics (ID vs VDS): Identifies ohmic, saturation, and cut-off regions

Transfer Characteristics (ID vs VGS): Shows control of gate voltage over drain current
