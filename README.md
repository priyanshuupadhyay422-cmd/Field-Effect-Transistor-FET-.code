What is a Field Effect Transistor?  A Field Effect Transistor (FET) is a voltage-controlled semiconductor device in which the output current is controlled by an electric field applied at the gate terminal.  FETs are unipolar devices, meaning current conduction occurs due to only one type of charge carrier.  🔹
